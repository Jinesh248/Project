        <p>Dear Billing Department,</p>

        <p>
          I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request clarification regarding certain charges listed in my recent medical bill issued by <strong>XYZ Hospital</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon reviewing the bill, I noticed the following discrepancies:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Duplicate Charge - CBC Blood Test:</strong>
            The Complete Blood Count (CBC) test appears to have been billed twice on the same date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overcharge - Paracetamol 650mg:</strong>
            The billed amount for Paracetamol 650mg seems significantly higher than standard pharmacy rates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unnecessary Medication - Pantoprazole Injection:</strong>
            This medication has been billed, but there is no supporting mention of gastric complications in the medical report.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I kindly request a detailed review of these charges and clarification at your earliest convenience. If any billing errors have occurred, I would appreciate the issuance of a revised invoice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your prompt response.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,<br>
